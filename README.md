# League-of-Legends-Game-Analysis

League of Legends (LoL) is a multiplayer online battle arena video game developed and published by Riot Games .It is a MOBA (multiplayer online battle arena) where 2 teams (blue and red) face off. In League of Legends, players assume the role of a 
"champion" with unique abilities and battle against a team of other player- or computer-controlled champions. There are 3 lanes, a jungle, and 5 roles. The goal is to take down the enemy Nexus to win the game.

In this project I am building models to predict the result of a game using first 10 minutes of games.
